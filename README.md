1. Create your React components and add your styles using Tailwind classes. You can also create new CSS files and import them into your components.

The project is set up to use `postcss-cli` to process your CSS files. You can add your own `tailwind.config.js` file to customize your Tailwind setup.

<<<<<<< HEAD
## Deployment

After building the application, you can deploy the contents of the `build` folder to any static hosting service like:

- Netlify
- Vercel
- GitHub Pages
- AWS S3
- Firebase Hosting

## API Integration

The frontend communicates with backend services through API calls. Make sure to:

1. Configure the API URL in the `.env` file
2. Handle API responses appropriately
3. Implement error handling for failed API calls

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port already in use**

   - Change the port by setting the `PORT` environment variable, e.g., `PORT=3001 npm start`

2. **API connection errors**

   - Verify your API URL and key in the `.env` file
   - Check if the API server is running and accessible

3. **Missing dependencies**
   - Run `npm install` or `yarn install` again
